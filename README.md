# To-Be-Top-Programmer
Hey, this is a note about learning programming from novice.
I'll take about one year to learn programming, and also I'll take down all my knownledge and experience in this repository.

# Get Started
The first part is about web design, I think it's the easiest way to get started with the programming. In the next 1 month, I'll learn html, css and Javascript for myself, I won't learn all of the knowledge at present, my target is just make something funny through programming.
